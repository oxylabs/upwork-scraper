Oxylabsâ€™ [Upwork Scraper](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api/web/upwork?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repositories&utm_campaign=product) is a data gathering solution allowing you to extract real-time information from an Upwork website effortlessly. This brief guide explains how an Upwork Scraper works and provides code examples to understand better how you can use it hassle-free.

### How it works

You can get Upwork results by providing your own URLs to our service. We can return the HTML for any Upwork page you like.

#### Python code example

The example below illustrates how you can get HTML of Upwork page.

```python
import requests
from pprint import pprint

# Structure payload.
payload = {
    'source': 'universal',
    'url': 'https://www.upwork.com/hire/landing/?utm_campaign=sembrand_google_intl_marketplace_core&utm_medium=paidsearch&utm_content=150606034558&utm_term=upwork&campaignid=20227594544&matchtype=e&device=c&partnerid=cj0kcqiayewrbhddarisagp1mwsp9zzkgwn_rdxwtubn7hqlmxlog0gmb0tscajaqy6fxziirl2vbyuaak0mealw_wcb&utm_source=google&cq_cmp=20227594544&cq_plac&cq_net=g&ad_id=660518288337&gad_source=1'
}

# Get response.
response = requests.request(
    'POST',
    'https://realtime.oxylabs.io/v1/queries',
    auth=('user', 'pass1'),
    json=payload,
)

# Instead of response with job status and results url, this will return the
# JSON response with the result.
pprint(response.json())
```
